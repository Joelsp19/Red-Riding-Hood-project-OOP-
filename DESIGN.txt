DESIGN

in WorldModel:
load() - loads the entities into the world so it makes sense that the WorlModel loads the world
processLine() - load is the only method that uses processLine(a helper method)
addEntitity() - adding an entity into the world/uses the entities instance variable of the class
tryAddEntity() - used a lot in parse*(), and utilizes addEntity()
parse*() - used a lot in processLine() so it makes sense to keep the functions in the same class

in Entity:
transform*() - the entity itself was transforming so it makes sense for this method to be a part of the entity class
findNearest()/nearestEntity() - it is looking for the nearest entity near a specific entity object
distanceSquared()/getNumFromRange() - only utilized in Entity, so they can be seen as helper functions/static util functions
that help implement some methods

in WorldView:
clamp() - only utilized in shiftView() which is in WorldView, so it is a static method that helps shiftView work

in ImageStore:
added some static final constants - these constants were only used in the ImageStore methods

in Functions:
moveTo* - there isn't a place to put moveTo functions that would represent an Entity moving to another target. 
create* - although these methods could be placed in Entity or Action classes since they involve the creation of
Entity and Action, it wouldn't make sense for a specific entity to create another Entity.
