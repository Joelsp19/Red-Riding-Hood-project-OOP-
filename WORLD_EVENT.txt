how to trigger the event:
The event is triggered by the second mouse click on a space in the world without an entity
(this is so that the keyboard controls can be activated first and the frame can be moved)

what should happen when the event is triggered:
Grandma's house is created, a long with a Wolf entity and cloud backgrounds. 

what the affected entities should do:
The effected entities are the fairies. The fairies turn into guardians that "upgrade" 
red riding hood by giving her a faster animation/action period (to some limit)
once the limit is reached, then the guardians give her cookies. 

what the new entity is and how it should behave:
The new entity created on click should follow red riding hood. He can move in 
diagnal and cardinal directions. Everytime the wolf moves adjacent to red riding hood
his animation/action period is slowed (he still has to digest what he ate). The world effect
area(clouds) are also increased
